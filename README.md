# Engine Oracle

A *Deep Learning Audio Classification* Project based on F1 Engine Data.

## Introduction

First and foremost, this project is not in the same vein of my previous one (aka. [StreamStats](https://github.com/RicardoSalgadoB/streamstats)). To begin with I don't really see any production use of what I've created here, that is why I didn't containerize it. I also tried to keep AI assistance as far away as I could, that meant  I had to follow the steps described in some online articles which I will promptly link in the following sections.

Overall, this is an Deep Learning project that seeks to analyze and classify some motorsport data. In order to do so it makes use of several libraries (**PyTorch**, **Librosa**, **Numpy**, ...) and many other techniques (*Short Time Fourier Transform*, *Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients*, *DataLoaders*, *Cross validation*, ...). I will describe in the following sections.

The purpose of this project is to showcase my Deep Learning skills and my capacity to build reliable models from raw audio data.

## Reasoning Process

I don't feel like writing a structured breakdown of the project, so I will just be giving a general overview of my reasoning process and the technologies and techniques implemented from its beginning to its very end.
